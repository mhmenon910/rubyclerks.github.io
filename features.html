		<h2>Products products products</h2>
		<p>
      The Product is what a company is all about. You buy or produce it, then you sell it and that
      is what you make your money from.
      <br/>
      Rubyclerks model of the Product is simple but not overly so. A product has a <b>name, 
      desciption, picture and price </b> for display. 
      A <b> weight </b> for shipping and a <b>tax rate</b> because you have to show 
      the tax by law (and it keeps changing).
      <br/>
      A barcode, usually <b>ean13</b> is what identifies a product uniquely and can be used for 
      scannig. A <b>supplier code</b> may be used for ordering it.
      <br/>
      Products may be grouped into <b>Product Groups</b> for displaying, and reporting. 
      <br/>
      Products may have key-value <b>attributes</b>, again mostly for displaying, and reporting. 
      <br/>
      A <b>Product line</b>may be created to group similar products to be displayed as one.

		<h2>Orders - you sell</h2>
		<p>
      Rubyclerk is very flexible in how you create orders, which are mostly just a list of 
      <b>items</b>. An item refers to a product at a certain time. You can think of an item
       as a physical entity. It copies the price and tax attributes so they never change later.
      <br/>
      The  <b>states</b> of an order reflect the lifecycle it goes through. 
      When you or a cusomer has finished creating the order it is <b>received</b>.
      <br/>
      Next it bay be <b>shipped or paid</b>, there is no restriction on which comes first.
      <br/>
      An order is <b>completed</b>, when it has been paid and shipped. Finally an order may be 
      <b>canceled</b> by you or the customer any time after it has been received
    </p>
    <p>
      Rubyclerks does not have integrated payment, so how you receive or return money is your 
      buisness (see modules).
      <br/> 
      But it does track inventory, and stock is reduced when an order is shipped and added when
      a shipped order is canceled. As phisical shipping is optional, so is customer address
       information.

		<h2>Purchase Orders - you buy</h2>
		<p>
      Rubyclerk assumes that you buy your products from <b>suppliers</b>, and each product 
      is (usually) supplied by one supplier. So this information may be stored int he product and
      used to automatically generated purchase orders when stock is low.
      <br/>
      The  <b>states</b> of a purchase order are simpler: it is <b>created</b> immediately 
      upon creation and unlike an order may be edited later. Until it is 
      <b>received</b>, at which point the items in it will be added to your stock.
      <br/>
      This is the normal way for buisnesses to receive goods and thus RubyClerks keeps track of
      the stock this way. You may also change stock values directly, but in that case it is not 
      recorded, and so your reporting will not be acurate. Usually this is only done during 
      inventory.

		<h2>Configuration</h2>
		<p>
      <br/>
      For simplicity RubyClerks treats some parts of the system as configuration, these are maily:
      <br/> 
      The list of <b>Countries</b> that you ship to.
      <br/> 
      The <b>Tax Rates</b> that you are subject too. Tax rates are taken to be a percentage
      of the product price (vat or european style).
      <br/> 
      Your <b>payment methods</b>. These are backed by code, only simple cash is built in.
      <br/> 
      The list of <b>shipping methods</b> you offer. Their names, rates and the code they are backed 
      by. RubyClerks provides Postal service style shipping, by weight.
      <br/> 
      Unlike other systems Rubyclerk does not store Configuration in the database, but in 
      configuration files. Those are assumed to be under revision control and this sytem allows for 
      much easier testing and evolution. It also removes such fantasy that you could set up 
      a payment method with a few clicks.

		<h2>And a little bit about what it's not</h2>
		<p>
      Rubyclerk, like all software, is made for a particular purpose. Defining this purpose 
      seems to count as opinionated nowadays, but it is really just drawing boundaries.
      Unlike other systems that may say they're not for everyone but then grow to accomodate almost
      everything anyone has ever thought of, RubyCerk intends to stay small. If it doesn't serve
      our buisness, it is unlikely to make it in.
      <br/>
      And even if, we persue the microkernel idea: if you can leave it out or do it in a module, do.
      Since ruby is extremely flexible . . . 
      <br/>
      A little list of things that are not intended
      <br/>
      <b>split shipments</b> This is one for the big boys, just create two orders.  <br/>
      <b>split payments</b> another big league feature. <br/>
      <b>us tax</b> may god (or spree) help them. If an extension needs small changes for this 
      i may actually bend a little <br/>
      <b>reporting</b> is important, but should be an extension <br/>
      <b>multiple storages</b> i may consider this after someone has demonstrated it in an extension<br/>
      <b>multiple stores</b> is it's own project<br/>
      <b>themes</b> we have css for that. Though view extensions will be accepted<br/>
      <b>db configuration</b> not practical and wasteful (all those db queries) <br/>
      <b>product matrixes</b> while popular in apparel are a view issue <br/>
      <b>refunds</b> are so rare for a small buisness that handling them by hand is ok <br/>
