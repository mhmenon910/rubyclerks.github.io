            <p>Torsten Ruger and Raisa Kaipainen, small buisness owners for 15 years, started this 
                at the end of 2013 with these goals:
                <br />
                <br /> <b>Simplicity</b>: This came mainly after seeing tryshoppe and how small
                it is compared to spree or ror-e, while still providing all functionality
                needed for our shop. Seeing that Adam managed to create tryshoppe in 3
                months gives credit to how much rails has evolved especially in terms of
                engines. Also it showed it could be done.
                <br /> <b>Learning</b>: Having been encouraged i thus embarked to learn more
                about rails4 and thus creating a platform from which to apply the wonderful
                new ideas of opal (or ember).
                <br /> <b>Stability</b>: Having used other tools that were always not quite right 
                for us, we wanted something that is small enough to change ourselves, stable 
                and functional. Once it's good, we don't see the need for constant change, and when changed,
                it should be easy on existing users (ie us).

         <h2 class="center">Rails</h2>
        <p>Often I hear thanks for providing us with day jobs. I don't have one of
            those :-(
            <br />Rather i took joy in seeing the pain removed. I used to do this stuff
            in Java before (1997-2002) and it's just so much more fun with rails. Also
            I think the actual web-stuff of rails is it's smallest achievement, rather
            the decent arm and schema management ranks tops and since bundler the whole
            management side too.
            <br />Thanks to the thousand of people who helped to make ruby a usable environment,
            and without completeness the authors of BeautyScaffolding, prawn, paperclip,
            rspec etc..</p>

         <h2 class="center">ror-e et al</h2>
        <p>David Henner has been a great help, both with encouragement and code.
            ror-e started as a spree clone, back in the time when I cut myself on the
            cutting edge, and Dave's code was and is a joy to read.</p>
        <p>Also I like to thank Sean and Brian of spree. It was after all what I
            used for the last years and they both have been friendly.</p>
        <p>Also I would like to thank Adam from tryshoppe for providing a great example
            of a simple web-shop. I got a lot of encouragement from that</p>

         <h2 class="center">UI guys</h2>
        <p>I've made web pages for 20 years and it has never been so <b>beautiful</b>.
            It's not that writing html has ever been difficult. But making it look
            good was.
            <br />Now it looks good,even when I do it !
            <br />There is a whole generation of people who have made the web look as good
            as it does now, thanks.</p>
        <p>I used <b>bootstrap</b> and <b>jquery</b> sometimes <b>flot</b> but there are
            so many and i am grateful for anyone in the area making it look better
            than I ever could.
            <br />
