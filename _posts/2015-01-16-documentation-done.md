More than 1 month later, the documentation is finally done too!

Now it's really time for a holiday. (Laos this time :-)

I know a very few little places that i will still polish. So small.... not worth mentioning.

Other than that we are at **release candite stage**. 

After the holiday, in april probably, it'll be 1.0 party!

Happy cloning
