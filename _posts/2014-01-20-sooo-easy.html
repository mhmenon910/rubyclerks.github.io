<h3>  Why didn't anyone tell me. If only i'd known! I would have done this years ago. </h3>

<p>
  It's a real shock. How can web development be so easy! I'm sure the work i did <b>last month</b> would have taken 
  a team of 3 half a year not soo long ago. By jolly.
<br/>
  Off course it's rails that does it. And the literally thousand of people spending what i hear are millions of hours
  to make the magic work. And it's got to be magic, when you can have
  <ul>
    <li> Controller methods without code that still do lots of work</li>
    <li> Use attributes on a model and they just pop out from the database without having to write any code</li>
    <li> You ca generate code that not only saves all the typing but shows how it's done!</li>
    <li> Pictures become attributes! Gosh, i could tell stories about the first uploads we ever did.</li>
    <li> Searching and pagination become a minimal amount of lines. 
        Even for pagination formatting to your chosen css framework is just another gem line.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h3> To the faceless millions, creating the vibrant community</h3>
<p>
  Really it is so much more than rails itself. It it the whole community around it.  
<br/>
  The first thing i do when i have a problem, (file upload/sorting/form writing/graphs/css/etc..) i go and look what 
  gems are available. It's just the biggest cookie store there is out there. Somebody will have had the problem, 
  and made a gem available. I can fork and edit if i want to tweek beyond the authors imagination and even
  easily give the work back. Git, Github, bundler are just ceating these great social practises. 
<br/>
  Off course if i don't find the solution, this encourages me to create one and put it out there. As a thanks and my
  participation. I'm not sure even Richard Stallman had the imagination to envision all this. It is a true achievement
  of our times, one of the very very few positive feedback loops we have, 
  and (in my more positive moments) gives a glimmer of hope for mankind.
