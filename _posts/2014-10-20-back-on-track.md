Ok, there was lull. Hard push and 2 months holiday started half a year of inactivity.*

But that's over now. Already we have lots more:

- shop cart (shop front was left undone)
- groups and product pages
- checkout page
- printing on admin side
- reporting

And plans to:

- finish the shop completely
- stripe payment
- postal shipment
- better spree conversion to convert our other shop




 *Actually that is now true: inactivity on this project. I have been very busy with my [virtual machine](http://dancinglightning.gitbooks.io/the-object-machine/content/)
