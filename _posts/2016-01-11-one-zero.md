Finally, a grown up version: 1.0

We have now been 2 years in production use, over 5000 orders a year. It's ready.

I just hope it is of use too.

Just a reminder: the ownership model is different from other projects: We do not provide a ready
shop, as the premise is that it if you use ruby to build a shop, you'll want something non-standard.
You may start by cloning ours to get up to speed quickly though.

Happy cloning
