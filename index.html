			<p>
        Rubyclerks is a system to manage a <em>small buisness</em>. 
        After using other systems for a long time, rubyclerk was written by a small buisness owner
        to provide exactly what a small buisness needs, in an understandable concise form.
      </p>
			<p>It is intended for people statrting out or running a small buisness where there is never 
        enough people and things have to be done efficiently.
			</p>
      <p> Rubyclerks provides the tools needed for this. 
        It allows you to manage products, ie buy, sell them and keep track of them. More precisely 
        there is a backend to greate product and with them orders (selling) but also purchase orders
        for buying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rubyclerks is itself small, but extensible, and open. We have a (small) list of extensions, like reporting and POS, and are happy to accept more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic core modules are listed below.

		<h2 class="center pink white">Simple but Comprehensive</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Simple is a much misunderstood concept often mistaken for simplistic. Simple means lack of complication, unneccessary clutter. Rubyclerks sticks to what a small buisness needs and lets others or modules extend this.</p>
			<p> Comprehensive means dealing with everything neccessary, and this off course only sensible within a scope. Our scope is the small buisness. Small is a few thousand products and max tens of thousand of orders a year.
			</p>
      <p>
        We understand comprehensive to mean that RubyClerks is the only server tool needed to run
         the buisness. 
         The system allows both online and offline selling and facillitates simple stock control.

		<h2 class="lightblue white center">Office clerk</h2>
		<p>
		  The office clerk, the core of the system, provides the back-office functionality. It allows you 
      to manage your products (prices,ean..), and organise them in groups. Simple ProductLine
      functionality is included. It allows you to sell these products by creating orders that can be 
      shipped to customers.
		</p>
    <p>
      The system assumes you have only one storage and the way you add stock is by receiving 
      your own orders. Thus you can can create purchase orders from suppliers and receive them.
    </p>
	</div>

	<div class="span4">
		<h2 class="lightblue white center">Online Clerk</h2>
		<p>
      This is the basis for your web-shop. Basic functionality around products, cart and
      login is included. But not payment or advanced shipping. Also this is meant to be used in
      one (european) country, in one language. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In technical terms, the office clerk is a gem, a rails engine actually, 
      but the online clerk a repository. You (a developer) are meant to clone the online clerk
      and change the appearance and workings to how you want your store to look and feel. 
      The office clerk is something that should stay as is and hopefully benefit from improvements
      that you and others make. 
    </p>
	</div>

	<div class="span4">
		<h2 class="lightblue white center">Sales clerk and more</h2>
		<p>
      The sales clerk is what is normally called POS, a point of sales system. It provides 
      a fast clean checkout with external payment and without shipment. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It is assumed that your products have barcodes, either ean13 or your own. Also it is assumed
       that your sales person uses a bar scanner and that you will print a receipt. 
       The "normal" checkout happens with just one click (printing).  
    </p>
    <p>
      If your products do not have barcodes, a barcode generater is included so you can print 
      your own codes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionlly a Reporting clerk, provides basic reporting to aid a shop owner in purchasing. 
      Hopefully many more modules will provide extra functionality in the future.
