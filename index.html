    <h2 class="center green white">Small business solution</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        RubyClerks is a system to manage a <b>small business</b>.
        After using other systems for a long time, RubyClerks was written by a small business owner
        to provide exactly what a small business needs, in an understandable concise form.
      </p>
      <p>It is intended for people starting out or running a small business where there is never
        enough people and things have to be done efficiently.
      </p>
      <p> RubyClerks provides the tools needed for this.
        It allows you to manage products, ie buy, sell and keep track of them. More precisely
        there is a backend to create product and with them orders (selling) but also purchase orders
        for buying.
      </p>
      <p>
        RubyClerks is itself small, but extensible, and open. We have a (small) list of extensions, 
        like reporting and POS, and are happy to accept more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic core modules are listed below.
      </p>

    <h2 class="center pink white">Simple but Comprehensive</h2>
    <div>
      <p><b>Simple</b> is a much misunderstood concept often mistaken for simplistic. 
          Simple means lack of complication, unnecessary clutter. 
          RubyClerks sticks to what a small business needs and lets others or modules extend this.</p>
      <p> <b>Comprehensive</b> means dealing with everything necessary, and this off course only sensible within 
          a scope. Our scope is the small business. Small is a few thousand products and max tens of 
          thousand of orders a year.
      </p>
      <p>
        We understand comprehensive to mean that RubyClerks is the only server tool needed to run
         the business.
         The system allows both online and offline selling and facilitates simple stock control.

    <h2 class="lightblue white center">Office clerk</h2>
    <p>
      The office clerk, the core of the system, provides the back-office functionality. It allows you
      to manage your products (prices,ean..), and organize them in groups. Simple ProductLine
      functionality is included. It allows you to sell these products by creating orders that can be
      shipped to customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system assumes you have only one storage and the way you add stock is by receiving
      your own pruchase orders. Thus you can can create purchase orders from suppliers and receive them.
    </p>
    <p>
       If your products have barcodes, either ean13 or your own, you can use admin side as a POS 
       (point of sales). So you or your sales person uses a bar scanner and you can print a receipt.
       The "normal" checkout happens with just one click (printing), a minimal transaction is one scan one click.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="span4">
    <h2 class="lightblue white center">Sales Clerk</h2>
    <p>
      This is the basis for your web-shop. Basic functionality around products, cart and
      login is included. But not payment or advanced shipping. Also this is meant to be used in
      one (european) country, in one language.
    </p>
    <p>
      In technical terms, the office clerk is a gem, a rails engine actually,
      but the sales clerk a repository. You (a developer) are meant to clone the sales clerk
      and change the appearance and workings to how you want your store to look and feel.
      The office clerk is something that should stay as is and hopefully benefit from improvements
      that you and others make.
    </p>

  <div class="span4">
    <h2 class="lightblue white center">Accounting clerk and more</h2>
    <p>
      The Accounting clerk, provides basic reporting to aid a shop owner in purchasing.
      Graphs of sales are shown and can be used to explore the sales and gain insight about customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Graphs let you "drill" down, so you can explore by <b>Time</b>, <b>Category</b>,<b>Supplier</b>
      or <b>any combination</b>. While for example retricting to a certain Supplier, cou can choose to 
      view sales by Catgory, or even by Product.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopefully many more modules will provide extra functionality in the future. Currently we have:
      <ul>
        <li> Printing of invoices and receipts</li>
        <li> Barcode reneration</li>
        <li> Weight based shipment methods</li>
        <li> Stripe based payment</li>
      </ul>
